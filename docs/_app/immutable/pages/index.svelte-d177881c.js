Inexperience with the boat, the waves and wind against us,                and the loss of the engine for use in coming through the tricky                NJ inlets led me to decide to make use of my TowBoat US membership.

I spent                the whole night bundled up in the cockpit on the lookout for some big                ship to come steaming straight for us out of the fog.                The only thing I'd have been able to do is scream on the radio, ring the                bell, and hope they'd hear or see us before it was too late. Luckily, the night                passed quietly.
