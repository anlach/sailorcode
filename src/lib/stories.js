               Chesapeake Light Craft. The kit came with machine-cut wood, \
               copper wire, and epoxy. First, you stitch it all together with \
               copper wire. Then, add lots of epoxy. Then, cut it in half and \
               paint. As you can see, it can be done in a bedroom if that's all \
               you have. There was a lot of sanding involved and it probably \
               took me over 200 hours to complete. I started out thinking this \
               would be on a Cape Dory 28, but it ended up fitting alright on the \
               Shannon 28 between the companionway and the mast. The name is \

               The next day was super gusty, though, and the boat was \

               smoked out of the cabin a few times I finally gave up on using \

               over a foot out of the stove vents back into the cabin. That was \
