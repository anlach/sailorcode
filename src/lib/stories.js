            For example, although the engine was running fine when we left Baltimore,\

            fuel pump a LOT more wear and tear. When the mechanical pump's diaphragm failed the first time \

               move the boat north. I had rented a big SUV that I used \
               to bring the dinghy down with, although we never actually \
               unshipped it the whole trip. \
               The first few days went okay - up the Chesapeake, through \
               the canal (stopping overnight), and then down the Delaware \
               to Cape May. However, the weather started to turn against us \
               on our first attempt to make progress in the Atlantic, and \
               while we were motoring the engine suddenly started running \
               louder and at a much higher frequency. It wouldn't shut \
               itself down for a scary 10 seconds or so while we pulled in vain on the kill \
               switch. Inexperience with the boat, the waves and wind against us, \
               and the loss of the engine for use in coming through the tricky \
               NJ inlets led me to decide to make use of my TowBoat US membership. We \
               got towed into Ocean City to have the engine checked. The next \

               with all the delays we had had. \
               When the fog rolled in as we were approaching New York, we \
               didn't have much of a choice but to press on until we could \
               anchor in Gravesend Bay. We could hear the deep fog horn of a \
               big ship approaching as we crossed Ambrose channel. After we \
               got mostly across the channel, we could \
               see the outline of this cruise ship moving fast across our \
               tracks. Add it to the growing list of things I would do \
               differently today. \
               The next day we had low clouds obscuring New York City, but \

               since discovered that due to the shape of my fuel tank, \
               it runs out pretty quickly once you get down past 1/4 tank. \
               Anyway, we ran out of fuel. We tried to sail east that night, but \
               there wasn't any wind, and then the fog rolled in. I spent \
               the whole night bundled up in the cockpit on the lookout for some big \
