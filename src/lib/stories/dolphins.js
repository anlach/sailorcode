    text: "It took four days to get to Cape Canaveral from Charleston. \
           I had light winds on the second day of the passage, and didn't \
           make much progress. But these dolphins joined me and the weather \
           was nice and warm. I had planned to come into the Ponce de \
           Leon inlet, but the conditions were nasty, so I hove to that night \
           and came into Cape Canaveral the next day. It was lucky timing, because \
           I saw an Atlas V rocket launch as I was coming in."
