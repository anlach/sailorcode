    text: "We stopped at Vinalhaven for what was only supposed to \
           be a couple of days, but a storm kept us penned in for a week. We \
           scavanged some wood to keep the stove going. Even \
           when we eventually left, the seas were pretty rough - 8 to 10 ft. \
           Going against that was very uncomfortable, so we didn't make it far."
